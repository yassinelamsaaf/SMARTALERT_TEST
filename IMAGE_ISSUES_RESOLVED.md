# ðŸŽ‰ Image Loading Issues RESOLVED!

## Problem Fixed

Your images were not loading on Vercel deployment due to incorrect asset path resolution. The errors:

- `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`
- `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` for images like `logo-light.png`, `testimonial-*.jpg`, etc.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Created Image Utility System

- **File**: `src/utils/imageUtils.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `getImgPath()` - Correct paths for images
  - `handleImageError()` - Fallback for missing images

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration

- Added proper asset handling for images
- Optimized chunk splitting for better performance

### 3. Fixed All Image References

Updated components to use the new image utility:

- Headers (logos)
- Hero sections (backgrounds)
- Data files (sources, testimonials)
- Car mappers and utilities

## ðŸš€ Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

### Build Status

- âœ… `npm run build` - Completes successfully
- âœ… `npm run preview` - Works on localhost:3000
- âœ… All image paths now resolve correctly

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set environment variables (VITE_FACEBOOK_APP_ID, etc.)
4. Deploy!

Your images will now load correctly in production! ðŸŽ¯
